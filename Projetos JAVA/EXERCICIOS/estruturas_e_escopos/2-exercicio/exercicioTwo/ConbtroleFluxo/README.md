## exercise 1

Create a simple project with variables and expressions to use in IF and SWITCH structures.

## exercise 2

With IF, display the name of the month of the year according to its number. Avoid the "arrow" effect. Also make another IF that checks if the month is July, December or January, in order to display the text "Holidays".

## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
